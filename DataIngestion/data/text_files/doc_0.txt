  Machine Learning Fundamentals
    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn
    and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. There are three main
    types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement
    learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised
    learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning learns through
    interaction with an environment using rewards and penalties.
