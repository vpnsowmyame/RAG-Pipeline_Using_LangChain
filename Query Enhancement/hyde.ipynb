Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.\\nJobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak\\'s Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. \\nJobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the largely unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing industry in 1985 (for example, the Aldus Pagemaker) with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript.\\nIn 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company\\'s board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets, serving as its CEO. In 1986, he bought the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm, which was spun off independently as Pixar. Pixar produced the first computer-animated feature film, Toy Story (1995), and became a leading animation studio, producing dozens of commercially successful and critically acclaimed films.\\nIn 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company\\'s acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the \"Think different\" advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App Store, and iPad. Jobs was also a board member at Gap Inc. from 1999 to 2002. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.

      "Steve Jobs’s departure from Apple wasn’t a sudden sack-in-the-office moment so much as the climax of a long, bruising power struggle. Here’s a concise, chronologically organized explanation of what happened and when:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Background  \n",
      "   – 1976–1983: Jobs co-founded Apple with Steve Wozniak and quickly became the public face and product visionary. Early successes (Apple I, Apple II) propelled him into the company’s executive ranks.  \n",
      "   – 1983: Concerned about his own management shortcomings, Jobs recruited PepsiCo executive John Sculley to be Apple’s CEO, famously asking, “Do you want to sell sugar water the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me and change the world?”  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. The Macintosh Launch and Early Tensions  \n",
      "   – January 1984: Apple unveiled the Macintosh. Though praised for its user-friendly GUI and the iconic “1984” Super Bowl ad, the Mac’s $2,495 price tag and limited software lineup hampered sales.  \n",
      "   – 1984–mid-1985: Market share gains stalled; the board and Sculley blamed Jobs’s mercurial management style and refusal to rein in Mac development costs. Jobs’s frequent clashes with other senior executives deepened mistrust.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. The Boardroom Coup  \n",
      "   – May–August 1985: Jobs attempted to wrest control of key marketing and operations functions from Sculley. In response, Sculley went to Apple’s board of directors, arguing that Jobs had become “too erratic” to run a $1 billion‐plus company.  \n",
      "   – August 19, 1985: In a pivotal board meeting, the directors voted overwhelmingly to strip Jobs of all operational responsibilities, reassigning him to a largely symbolic “Macintosh Founder” role.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Official Departure  \n",
      "   – September 17, 1985: After several weeks of internal negotiations and increasingly untenable relations with Sculley, Jobs resigned from Apple. Though he was not literally “fired on the spot,” this date marks the point at which he left the company he co-founded.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. Aftermath and Return  \n",
      "   – 1985–1996: Jobs went on to found NeXT Inc., and in 1986 purchased Pixar Animation Studios. Meanwhile, Apple struggled without his visionary drive.  \n",
      "   – December 1996 – July 1997: Apple acquired NeXT, bringing Jobs back as an advisor. By September 1997 he was named interim CEO (“iCEO”), and in 2000 formally resumed the title of Apple’s chief executive—setting the stage for the iMac, iPod, iPhone and Apple’s resurgence.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Key Takeaway  \n",
      "Steve Jobs’s “firing” was really the culmination of a months-long power struggle that reached its denouement in August 1985, with his formal resignation on September 17, 1985. Rather than a single dramatic moment, it was a boardroom decision triggered by concerns over declining Mac sales and conflicting management styles.\n"
